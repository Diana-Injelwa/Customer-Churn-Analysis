# Customer-Churn-Analysis
This project is a demonstration of how Power BI can be used to turn raw data into meaningful insights. The data set used in this project is from a telecommunications company that provides phone and internet services to 7043 customers in California. The data includes information about customer demographics, location, services and current status.

To start the analysis, the data was first cleaned in Python using Pandas and NumPy libraries to prepare it for use in Power BI.

To create the visualizations, I utilized DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create measures and calculated columns . DAX is a formula language used in Power BI to create custom calculations and aggregations. Calculated columns are a type of column in Power BI that allows users to create new columns based on existing data.

The visualizations created in this project reveals the key drivers of customer churn and recommendations to improve customer retention.
